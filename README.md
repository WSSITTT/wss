About

The WSS IT Club is dedicated to fostering innovation and practical skills in various fields of technology. Our expertise spans:

    Arduino Microcontrollers: Building interactive electronics and automation systems.

    LEGO Mindstorms Robotics: Creating programmable robots for problem-solving challenges.

    Scratch Programming: Teaching computational thinking through visual coding.

    Computer Building & Repair: Hands-on hardware workshops and tech support.

    3D Printing: Designing and prototyping physical components.

    Advanced Software Development: Developing innovative solutions for various applications.

This website serves as a dynamic portfolio of our work and a hub for information about our club.
Features

‚ú® Modern, Bubble-Glassy Aesthetic: A sleek, dark theme with vibrant neon green and blue accents, featuring translucent, blurred elements and glowing effects.
‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic 3D Background: An interactive Three.js powered background showcasing floating 3D models of CPUs, RAM sticks, and PC cases, connected by sparking wires.
üöÄ Smooth Scrolling Navigation: Effortlessly navigate between sections with smooth scroll animations.
üîó Clean URL Routing: Experience a modern web feel with clean URLs (e.g., /our-team instead of #our-team-section), managed client-side for a single-page application experience.
üì± Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across all devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
üñºÔ∏è Interactive Project Showcase: A dynamic slideshow with image and video content, complete with navigation controls and thumbnails.
‚ö° Service Worker for Offline Access: The website is progressive web app (PWA) ready, offering offline capabilities for cached content.
üåü Intersection Observer Animations: Sections animate into view as you scroll, creating an engaging "video presentation" effect.
Technologies Used

    HTML5: For structuring the web content.

    CSS3: For styling and animations, implementing the bubble-glassy theme.

    JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive elements, DOM manipulation, and client-side routing.

    Three.js (r128): A JavaScript 3D library used for rendering the interactive 3D background.

    Service Worker API: For enhancing the website with offline capabilities and faster loading times.

Setup and Installation

To run this project locally:

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/waterloo-robotics.git
    cd waterloo-robotics

    Open index.html:
    Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Due to the service worker and clean URL routing, it's recommended to serve this project via a local web server (e.g., using Python's http.server or Node.js's serve package) for the best experience, especially for navigation and PWA features.

    Using Python:

    python -m http.server 8000

    Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

    Using Node.js (serve package):

    npm install -g serve
    serve .

    Then, open your browser and go to the address provided by serve (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Navigation

The website uses client-side routing to provide clean URLs without page reloads.

    Home: /

    Our Team: /our-team

    Our Projects: /our-projects

    Past Events: /past-events

    Project Showcase: /project-showcase

Clicking on navigation links or using browser back/forward buttons will smoothly scroll you to the corresponding section.
3D Background

The interactive 3D background is powered by Three.js and features:

    Floating Components: Animated 3D models of CPUs, RAM sticks, and generic PC cases.

    Sparking Wires: Subtle glowing lines connecting the components, with occasional spark effects.

    Parallax Effect: The camera subtly shifts based on mouse movement, adding depth to the scene.
